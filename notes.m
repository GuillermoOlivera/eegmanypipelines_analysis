% time/data points issue seem fixed now

% unresolved:
% - noise in the erps signal, data were also pre-proc. with a more severe
% low pass cut off at 20 Hz - and it does not get better.
% see the data averaged between subjects, that noise may cancel-out but
% still it needs further investigation

% name codes for hyp
%% - preprocessing_hyp1_angui: investigating N1 component (manmade vs nat.env.)
% all data preprocessed in folder _generated
% look at the data (see above unresolved issue)

%% preprocessing_hyp2a: investigating later component (new vs old)
% run the code and see the data later today in _generated_hyp2a
% here 4 conditions, to keep the distintion between image type,
% not sure if this is what they want but we combine them later to have over
% all new vs old.
