* Objective and analysis
The objective of the data analysis is to test the following hypotheses:
** First Hypothesis - scene category effect
There is an effect of scene category (i.e., a difference between images showing
man-made vs. natural environments) on the amplitude of the N1 component, i.e. the
first major negative EEG voltage deflection.

** Second Hypothesis - image novelty
There are effects of image novelty (i.e., between images shown for the first time/new
vs. repeated/old images) within the time-range from 300â€“500 ms ...

a. on EEG voltage at fronto-central channels.\n
b. on theta power at fronto-central channels.\n
c. on alpha power at posterior channels.\n

** Third Hypothesis - "succesfully" detect old images
There are effects of successful recognition of old images (i.e., a difference between
old images correctly recognized as old [hits] vs. old images incorrectly judged as new
[misses]) ...

a. on EEG voltage at any channels, at any time.
b. on spectral power, at any frequencies, at any channels, at any time.

** Fourth Hypothesis - subsequent memory
There are effects of subsequent memory (i.e., a difference between images that will
be successfully remembered vs. forgotten on a subsequent repetition) ...

a. on EEG voltage at any channels, at any time.
b. on spectral power, at any frequencies, at any channels, at any time.
